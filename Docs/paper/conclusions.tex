We have presented results for Higgs boson pair production in gluon
fusion at full NLO for non-standard values of the trilinear Higgs
boson coupling $\lambda$. The total cross section is a quadratic
polynomial in $\lambda$, with a minimum around $\chhh\approx 2.4$,
which is present both at LO and NLO with full top quark mass
dependence, stemming from destructive interference of diagrams with
and without a trilinear Higgs coupling. 
The $\mhh$ distribution shows a dip around this minimum, which is to
less extent also visible in the transverse momentum distribution of
one of the Higgs bosons. 
We have assumed in our study that modifications of the Higgs couplings
to other particles are small and can be increasingly well constrained by
other processes. Nonetheless it should be kept in mind that a dip in
the $\mhh$ distribution could also originate from other effective
couplings, for example an effective $t\bar{t}HH$ coupling, while
$\chhh= 1$~\cite{Buchalla:2018yce}.

We have also combined our NLO QCD results with the \pythia and \herwig
parton showers, where in the \herwig case we employed both the default shower (the angular-ordered $\tilde{q}$-shower) and the dipole shower.
We observed that \ait{ToDo}.

The \powheg{} version of the code for Higgs boson pair production
including the possibility to vary the trilinear coupling 
and the top quark Yukawa coupling 
is publicly available in the \powhegbox{\tt-V2} package at the website
{\tt http://powhegbox.mib.infn.it}, in the
{\tt User-Processes-V2/ggHH/} directory.
