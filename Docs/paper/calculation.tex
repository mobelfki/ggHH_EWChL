The calculation builds on the one presented in Ref.~\cite{Heinrich:2017kxx} and therefore will be described only briefly here. 

The leading order amplitude in the full theory and  all the
amplitudes in the $m_t\to\infty$ limit were implemented analytically, whereas the
one-loop real radiation contribution and the two-loop virtual
amplitudes in the full SM rely on numerical or semi-numerical
codes.

The real radiation matrix elements in the full SM were implemented
using the interface~\cite{Luisoni:2013cuh}
between \gosam~\cite{Cullen:2011ac,Cullen:2014yla} and
the \powhegbox~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd}, modified
accordingly to compute the real corrections instead of the virtual
ones. The one-loop real amplitudes we generated with the version
2.0 of \gosam{}~\cite{Cullen:2014yla}, that
uses {\tt Qgraf}~\cite{Nogueira:1991ex}, \form~\cite{Kuipers:2012rf} and
{\tt spinney}~\cite{Cullen:2010jv} for the generation of the Feynman
diagrams, and offers a choice from {\tt
Samurai}~\cite{Mastrolia:2010nb,vanDeurzen:2013pja}, {\tt
golem95C}~\cite{Binoth:2008uq,Cullen:2011kv,Guillet:2013msa}
and \ninja{}~\cite{Peraro:2014cba} for the
reduction.  At run time the amplitudes were computed using
\ninja{}~\cite{Peraro:2014cba} and \avholo{}~\cite{vanHameren:2010cp}
for the evaluation of the scalar one-loop integrals.

For the virtual two-loop amplitudes, we have used the results of the
calculation presented in Refs.~\cite{Borowka:2016ehy,Borowka:2016ypz},
which used also {\sc Reduze}\,2~\cite{vonManteuffel:2012np} and {\sc
 SecDec}\,3~\cite{Borowka:2015mxa}.

The values for the Higgs boson and top quark masses have been set to
$m_h=125$\,GeV and $m_t=173$\,GeV, such that the two-loop amplitudes
only depend on two independent variables, the Mandelstam invariants
$\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$.  We have constructed a grid in these
variables together with an interpolation framework, such that an
external program can call the virtual two-loop amplitude at any phase space
point without having to do costly two-loop integrations.
We used the same setup for the grid as described in Ref.~\cite{Heinrich:2017kxx} and extended it in the following way:
We can write the squared matrix element as a polynomial of degree two in $\lambda$, 
\begin{align}
M_\lambda& \equiv |{\cal M}_\lambda|^2=A+B\,\lambda + C\,\lambda^2\;. \label{eq-amplambdadep}
\end{align}
Therefore it is sufficient to know the amplitude at three different values of $\lambda$ in order to reconstruct the full $\lambda$-dependence. 
Choosing $\lambda=-1,0,1$ we obtain
\begin{align}
A&=M_0\;,\; B=(M_1-M_{-1})/2\;,\; C=(M_1+M_{-1})/2-M_0\;.
\end{align}
In practice we used the representation 
\begin{align}
M_\lambda &=M_0\,(1-\lambda^2)+\frac{M_1}{2}\,(\lambda+\lambda^2) + \frac{M_{-1}}{2}\,(-\lambda+\lambda^2)\;
\end{align}
in order to get a more straightforward uncertainty estimate.

In fact, to any order in QCD, we can separate the matrix element into a 
piece that depends only on the top quark Yukawa coupling $y_t$ (``box diagrams'') and a 
piece that depends on the Higgs boson tri-linear self coupling $\lambda$ (``triangle diagrams''):
\begin{align}
{\cal M} = y_t^2 {\cal M}_B + y_t \lambda {\cal M}_T.
\end{align}
The squared amplitude at each order can then be written as
\begin{align}
|{\cal M}|^2 = y_t^4 \left[ {\cal M}_B {\cal M}_B^* + \frac{\lambda}{y_t} ({\cal M}_B {\cal M}_T^* + {\cal M}_T {\cal M}_B^* ) +  \frac{\lambda^2}{y_t^2} {\cal M}_T {\cal M}_T^*  \right].
\end{align}
The above parametrisation makes it clear that the dependence of the cross section on
both the Yukawa coupling and the Higgs boson self coupling can be reconstructed
from only the 3 terms present in Eq.~\ref{eq-amplambdadep}.

In order to allow for comparisons and cross checks, we implemented
both the $m_t\to\infty$ limit as well as the full SM amplitudes at
NLO. This allows to run the code in four different modes by changing
the flag {\tt mtdep} in the \powhegbox{} run card. The possible
choices and the corresponding calculation, as presented in the
previous section, are the following:
\begin{description}
 \item[{\tt mtdep=0}:]{computation using basic HEFT,}
 \item[{\tt mtdep=1}:]{computation using Born-improved HEFT,}
 \item[{\tt mtdep=2}:]{computation in the approximation \ftapprox (full
   mass dependence in the Born and in the real radiation, Born-improved HEFT
   for the virtual part),}
 \item[{\tt mtdep=3}:]{computation in the full SM.}
\end{description}

\vspace*{1cm}

When {\tt mtdep=3} is selected, the result of the virtual matrix element is based on a grid of pre-sampled points as described above. The phase-space points present in the grid are distributed such that they optimally sample the SM Born matrix element. The same grid of points is used regardless of the value of $\lambda$ selected. Due to the finite number of points present in the grid, there is an associated statistical uncertainty which amounts to $0.1\%$ on the total cross section at $14\ \TeV$ for $\lambda=\lambda_\mathrm{sm}$. However, for $\lambda \neq \lambda_\mathrm{sm}$ the virtual matrix element can differ significantly in shape from the SM prediction, as is apparent from examining the $\mhh$ and $\pth$ distributions for different values of the Higgs boson self coupling. The uncertainty associated with the use of the grid is therefore larger for non-SM values of $\lambda$. The uncertainty increases as $\lambda$ is decreased below the SM value reaching $0.6\%$ on the total cross section at $14\ \TeV$ for $c_{hhh} = -1$. Increasing $\lambda$ above the SM value, we obtain an uncertainty of $3\%$ on the total cross section at $14\ \TeV$ for $c_{hhh} = 3$ and  $c_{hhh} = 5$. Furthermore, for differential distributions the total uncertainty is not distributed uniformly in each bin but instead increases when the shape of the matrix element most differs from the SM prediction. Focusing on the invariant mass distribution, amongst the values of the Higgs boson self-coupling considered here, the largest uncertainty is obtained for the smallest values of $\mhh$ and $c_{hhh}=3$. The uncertainty reaches $6\%$ for the lowest bin when a $40\ \GeV$ bin width is used.
