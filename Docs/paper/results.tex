The results were obtained using the
PDF4LHC15{\tt\_}nlo{\tt\_}30{\tt\_}pdfas~\cite{Butterworth:2015oua,CT14,MMHT14,NNPDF}
parton distribution functions interfaced to our code via
LHAPDF~\cite{Buckley:2014ana}, along with the corresponding value for
$\alpha_s$.  The masses of the Higgs boson and the top quark have been
fixed, as in the virtual amplitude, to $m_h=125$\,GeV, $m_t=173$\,GeV,
respectively. Their widths have been set to zero.   
Jets are clustered with the
anti-$k_T$ algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp} as implemented in the
{\tt fastjet} package~\cite{Cacciari:2005hq, Cacciari:2011ma}, with jet
radius $R=0.4$ and a minimum transverse momentum 
$p_{T,min}^{\rm{jet}}=20$\,GeV.  The scale uncertainties are
estimated by varying the factorisation/renormalisation scales
$\mu_{F}, \mu_{R}$. The scale variation bands 
represent the envelopes of a 7-point scale variation
around the central scale $\mu_0 =\mhh/2$, with
$\mu_{R,F}=c_{R,F}\,\mu_0$, where $c_R,c_F\in \{2,1,0.5\}$ where the
extreme variations $(c_R,c_F)=(2,0.5)$ and $(c_R,c_F)=(0.5,2)$ have
been omitted.
